    """Detect architectural smells in the recovered architecture.

    Detects four smell types:
    1. Dependency Cycle (BDC): SCC-based cycle detection (always algorithmic)
    2. Concern Overload (BCO): Component covers too many concerns
    3. Scattered Parasitic Functionality (SPF): Concern scattered across components
    4. Link/Upstream Overload (BUO): Heavily depended-on components (always algorithmic)

    When ``use_llm=True``, smell types 2 and 3 are detected by sending the
    architecture to Claude CLI for semantic analysis instead of using
    heuristic thresholds.  Requires the ``claude`` CLI to be installed and
    authenticated.  Set ``ARCADE_MOCK=1`` to skip LLM calls.

    Args:
        architecture: The recovered architecture.
        dep_graph: The dependency graph.
        use_llm: Use Claude CLI for concern-based smell detection (default: False).

    Returns:
        List of SmellInstance objects.
