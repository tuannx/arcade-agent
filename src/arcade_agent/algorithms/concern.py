1. **Concern Overload** (BCO): A component has too many responsibilities or

   vague responsibility, entities with diverse naming patterns suggesting
   multiple concerns mixed together.

2. **Scattered Parasitic Functionality** (SPF): A single concern (e.g.,

   many unrelated components instead of being centralized.  Signs: similar
   entity names, suffixes, or functional patterns appearing across multiple
   components.
